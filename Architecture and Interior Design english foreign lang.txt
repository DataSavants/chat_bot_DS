Other Foreign Languages

Language offered

FRENCH
The French language was introduced in SRMIST in the year 2006. Every year 1000 plus students learn the French language during their first year. We train students for Certification courses like DELF. We collaborated with the French embassy, and we used to get French natives in exchange for taking classes for our students. We train students to gain admission to foreign universities (on demand).


GERMAN
Around 1500 students learn German every year, and we plan to increase the footprint. Apart from language learning, students are allowed to take certification courses, and the tests are sent to Goethe Institute. Around 75 students attended the A1 level course, and 52 took the exam. In the session of the A2 level, 14 students participated in the course. Every year, students were trained in A1 level and A2 level courses to take the exam.


JAPANESE
Engineering students benefit significantly from instruction in the three Japanese scripts: Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. As more and more Japanese clients seek software solutions from India, knowing the language is a definite advantage for fresh engineers who intend to join software companies. Four of our faculty attended the Teacher training programme offered by Japan Foundation (JENESYS), Urawa, Japan. Around 60 students participated in the JLPT N5 course the Department of English & Foreign Languages provided. Approximately 15 students attended the JLPT N4 course the Department of English & Foreign Languages offered. About 30 students participated in the MARUGOTO course by the Department of English & Foreign Languages. The native speakers and our faculty teach the courses.

Taiwan Education Center (TEC) at SRMIST was established by National Tsing Hua University and funded by the Taiwan Ministry of Education and Foreign Affairs of the Taiwan Government in 2016. The Taiwan Education Center at SRMIST (Known as TEC-SRMIST) offers Mandarin language courses and imparts different levels of lessons. Also, host the Chinese language proficiency test (TOCFL) for Indian students. TEC-SRM has collaborated with the department of English and foreign language at SRMIST since 2016. It not only conducts the mandatory credit course for SRMIST ENT students and opens certificate courses for all college students.


KOREAN
The Korean language was introduced in the year 2008 to Engineering students. Only native Korean speakers taught students from 2008 to till 2018. The blooming of small Korean firms in India motivates our students to choose Korean in academics.


SPANISH
Spanish was introduced in 2022 in addition to other languages in the Department of English & Foreign languages. Learning a foreign language is similar to embarking on a journey of discovery. The delight of discovery has always been associated with the Spanish language. The dedication and enthusiasm of the faculty assist students in reaching nothing less than perfection. They understand the significance of their culture and civilization as they learn to respect another culture significantly different from their own as a Foreign Language. Spanish is the primary language in 20 countries worldwide, and about 75 million people speak it as a second or foreign language. The Spanish language as a second language grew 60% higher, according to the 2020 edition of Spanish in the world by Instituto Cervantes.
